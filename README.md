Design and Implementation of Lexical Analyzer for Classification algorithms 

Disclaimer: The program requires python 2.7

Steps to run the code:

1. Download all the files to directory containing python application

2. Run the lexer.py directly by opening file in Python 2.7
   or 
   Type the following code in python application:

                                                import lexer
                                                lexer.main()

Note:
> Make sure the test case files are in the same folder as the lexer.py program for convenience.

> The output will be stored in a file named INPUTFILENAMEOutput.txt where INPUTFILENAME is the name of the file on which the lexical analysis is done.
